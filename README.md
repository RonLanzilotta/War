# W A R

### In this classic card game, players rely solely on luck of the draw to deploy their cards to the battlefield where the high card is always victorious.


    Danish developer Einar Egilsson once said about the game, "Much like real war, it's incredibly long and pointless". He was referring of course to the game's utter lack of logic or strategy and that it instead relies entirely on luck of the draw to play. Somehow the game has endured as entertainment, mostly for children, for at least 200 years. Variants like Bettelmann ("Beggar Man") and Tod und Leben ("Life and Death") have been known in Germany since the early 1800's.

    The game is won when a player has collected all cards. Players shuffle and divide a deck in half between them. They each flip the top card in their hand and high card wins both cards shown and puts them in a separate pile. If there is a tie, the players have WAR. Each player puts 3 cards face down in the center and flip their fourth card to compare. Continue this process until a high card appears. If a player does not have enough cards to conduct a war or has no cards left, the game is over.
    
    Despite of, or perhaps because of its simplicity, the game is known today all over the world by different regional names. I grew up calling it WAR, and couldn't resist the nostalgic challenge when it came time to choose a game for this project.

    [WAR](https://RonLanzilotta.github.io/War)

    -Click the nuclear button only one time.
    -Use the "Play" button on the player's deck to advance gameplay.

## Next Steps

    There were many ideas that I was unable to implement before this project was due. I hope to get to some of these in the coming weeks:

    1. Break the "Deal" button after start.
    2. Build reset button.
    3. Counters for the deck and hand.
    4. Card flip and shuffle animations.
    5. During war, click the war button once for each card moved to the gameboard.
    6. Turn gameboard tint red during war.
    7. Fix message to corner of table, regardless of screen size.
    8. Screen size responsiveness.
    9. Message text fade in.
